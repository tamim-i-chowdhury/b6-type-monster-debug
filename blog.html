                localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs
                (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are
                near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole
                exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests)
                is only available for the duration of the browser session (and
                is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however,
                survive page reloads. Clearly, if the data you are storing needs
                to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is
                preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can
                be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing
                existence of data in either case. localStorage and
                sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data
                needed within client scripts between pages (for example:
                preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage
                and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the
                client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of
                sensitive or security-related data within applications.
