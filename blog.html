                localStorage and sessionStorage are relatively new APIs
                (meaning, not all legacy browsers will support them) and are
                near identical (both in APIs and capabilities) with the sole
                exception of persistence. sessionStorage (as the name suggests)
                is only available for the duration of the browser session (and
                is deleted when the tab or window is closed) - it does, however,
                survive page reloads. Clearly, if the data you are storing needs
                to be available on an ongoing basis then localStorage is
                preferable to sessionStorage - although you should note both can
                be cleared by the user so you should not rely on the continuing
                existence of data in either case. localStorage and
                sessionStorage are perfect for persisting non-sensitive data
                needed within client scripts between pages (for example:
                preferences, scores in games). The data stored in localStorage
                and sessionStorage can easily be read or changed from within the
                client/browser so should not be relied upon for storage of
                sensitive or security-related data within applications.

                The Javascript global scope is the context where everything in a
                Javascript program executes by default. This scope includes all
                variables, objects, and references that are not contained within
                a customized scope defined by a programmer. Global scope is the
                entire Javascript execution environment. Block Level Scope: This
                scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific
                block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const
                keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped.

                Undefined value primitive value is used when a variable has not
                been assigned a value. A declared variable but not yet assigned
                with a value (uninitialized) is by default undefined. When
                accessing a non-existing object property, JavaScript returns
                undefined. Implicitly, without return statement, a JavaScript
                function returns undefined. Undefined represents the value of a
                variable that hasn't been yet initialized, while null represents
                an intentional absence of an object.

                Event loop is an endless loop, which waits for tasks, executes
                them and then sleeps until it receives more tasks. The event
                loop executes tasks from the event queue only when the call
                stack is empty i.e. there is no ongoing task. The event loop
                allows us to use callbacks and promises.
